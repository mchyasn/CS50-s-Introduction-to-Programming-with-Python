# CS50 Shirtificate

This Python program is an implementation to [CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python Week 8 - CS50 Shirtificate Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/8/shirtificate/). The CS50 Shirtificate program, implemented in `shirtificate.py`, creates a customized PDF certificate with a user's name overlaid on an image of a CS50 "I took CS50" t-shirt.

## Program Explanation

The `Shirtificate` class is a subclass of the `FPDF` class from the `fpdf2` library. It is designed to create a PDF certificate with the following features:

- The PDF is in portrait orientation.
- The format of the PDF is A4 (210mm wide by 297mm tall).
- The top of the PDF says "CS50 Shirtificate" as text, centered horizontally.
- The shirt's image is centered horizontally.
- The user's name is on top of the shirt in white text.

## How to Use the Program

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `shirtificate.py` file.

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. Run the program using the `python` command:

   ```sh
   python shirtificate.py
   ```

4. The program will interactively prompt you to enter your name.
5. After entering your name, a file named `shirtificate.pdf` will be generated in the same directory.

## Class Explanation

The `Shirtificate` class is designed to create a shirtificate with the user's name on it. Here's how it works:

1. The `header` method adds the "CS50 Shirtificate" header to the top of the PDF.
2. The `create_shirtificate` method adds the shirt's image, the user's name, and other details to the PDF.
3. The `main` function collects the user's name, creates an instance of the `Shirtificate` class, and generates the shirtificate PDF.

## How to Test

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `shirtificate.py` file.

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. Run the tests using the `check50` command:

   ```sh
   check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/shirtificate
   ```

4. The tests will run, and you will see the results indicating whether the program passes each test case.

## Submitting Your Work

To submit your work, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/shirtificate
```

This will allow CS50 to test your program and provide feedback on its correctness.

## Additional Notes

- The program uses the `fpdf2` library to create the PDF certificate.
- The `Shirtificate` class extends the functionality of the `FPDF` class to customize the shirtificate's appearance.
- The program prompts the user for their name and generates a customized PDF certificate.
- The generated PDF certificate, `shirtificate.pdf`, will be created in the same directory as the `shirtificate.py` file.
