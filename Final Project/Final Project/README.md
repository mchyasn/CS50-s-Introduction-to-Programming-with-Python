# Password Manager

This Python program is an implementation to [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python Final Project - Password Manager](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/project/). The **Password Manager** is a simple command-line tool built in Python that allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete passwords for different websites or services securely. It employs the bcrypt library for password hashing and provides functionalities to generate strong random passwords as well. This README will guide you through the functionality of the Password Manager and provide instructions on how to run and test the code.
